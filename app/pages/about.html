            <h4>Poke Pathfinder is a short demo inspired by the widely popular franchise, Pokemon.
                This demonstration allows users to use pathfinding algorithms to explore an infamous
                location in Pokemon world, Cerulean Cave.</h4>
    
            <h4>This project is an excellent tool for teaching others about the mechanics of pathfinding algorithms.
                There are many features that allow users to tweak which alorithm is used and how it is implement.</h4>
    
            <h4>Using Poke-Pathfinder is easy and fun!</h4>
