                        <h4 class="paragraph">Poke-Pathfinder is a short demo inspired by the widely popular franchise, Pokémon.
                            This demonstration allows users to explore an infamous location in the Pokémon world, Cerulean Cave, by using
                        pathfinding algorithms.</h4>
                        
                        <h4 class="paragraph">This project is an excellent tool for teaching others about the mechanics of pathfinding algorithms.
                            There are many features that allow users to tweak and observe how the algorithms are implemented.</h4>

                        <h3 class="section-heading">How To Play</h3>
                        <h4 class="paragraph">Using Poke-Pathfinder is fun and easy! Just follow the instructions below to get started.</h4>
                        <ol class="list">
                            <li>Select the algorithm</li>
                            <p>There are four algorithms to choose from: Breadth-first Search, Depth-first Search, Dijkstra's and A*.</p>
                            <p>If you're using Dijkstra's or A*, you have the option of modifying the weights of different tiles in the cave. 
                                Experiment to see how the algorithms change depending on the weights applied.</p>
                            
                            <li>Choose a Start Location</li>
                            <p>You can start your player from anywhere in the cave. Move him around in Cave view (tablet and desktop only) by dragging and dropping him. 
                                Or move around the green source marker to determine where the pathfidner will start from.</p>
                            
                            
                            <li>Choose an End Location</li>
                            <p>Where should your player go? Choose from one of the available options, 
                                or move around the checkered marker to determine his destination. 
                                You can also select <i>All Tiles</i> as the hero's destination. This allows you to visualize the algorithm as it generates paths from
                            a single tile to all other tiles on the map. Note that you cannot use this option with A* because of the nature of the algorithm. You also
                            cannot use this option with the <i>Follow Path</i> task.</p>
                            
                            <li>Choose a Task</li>
                            <p>You can elect to follow and construct a path, or generate a frontier.</p>
                            <p>If you <i>Follow Path,</i> the player will find his way to his final destination all by himself.</p>
                            <p>If you want to get a sense of how the algorithm works, you can choose <i>Generate Frontier</i> to watch a visualization.
                                The yellow arrows are nodes that are currently in the open list. The gradient tiles are in the closed list. 
                                The color of the gradient indicates either the distance from the source, or the total weight from the source 
                                (depending on the algorithm you're using). The arrows each point to their parent.</p>
                            
                            <li>Choose Your Settings</li>
                            <p>Tweak the game to your liking. Play with the layers to gain different perspectives. 
                                Increase the speed, if you're feeling impatient. And choose the gender that you most closely identify with.</p>

                        <h3 class="section-heading">Implementation Details</h3>
                        
                        
                        <h4 class="paragraph">This small game is built entirely in 
                            JavaScript. The game itself is built in vanilla JavaScript, 
                            with a bit of jQuery. And the website is built on AngularJS and Bootstrap.</h4>
                        
                        <h4 class="paragraph">The game consists of many of the regular 
                            mechanics that are employed by virtually all full games. The game 
                            runs through a loop, and achieves smooth movement through interpolation. 
                            Information about the nodes and their neighbors is stored in a 
                            graph, which determines which tiles are accessible as well as 
                            enabling all of the algorithms to work. The character sprites 
                            (both male and female player, Mewtwo, the surf pokémon, even the 
                            dust when the hero finishes surfing) are maintained with a spritesheet.</h4>
                        
                        <h4 class="paragraph">The map of the game is implemented with a 
                            combination of bitmap images and canvas objects. The static 
                            parts of the map are bitmap images. They are layered and 
                            controlled with JavaScript in both Cave view and Game Boy view. 
                            The movement of the water and the foreground/background effect 
                            (observed when the player is surfing) was achieved using CSS
                            and JavaScript to change offsets and z-indeces as necessary.</h4>
                        
                        <h4 class="paragraph">The game also employs canvases to draw the sprite,
                            the path, the frontier, and the <i>Graphic</i> layer. The <i>Graphic</i> layer
                            shows the map in its simplest form: as a grid of 2D tiles, each of which has different properties.
                            It offers another way of analyzing and understanding movement within the game.
